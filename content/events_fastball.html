          <span><p><img width="360" hspace="8" height="218" align="left" src="img/fastball.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive"/>GT&amp;T is the brainchild behind several innovative events that provide an opportunity for Guyanese to be winners and be recognized for their talents and worth!</p>
<p>Following the tremendous success of GT&amp;T&rsquo;s 10/10 Soft Ball Cricket in 2010, the company wanted to provide another opportunity for Guyanese, to showcase their talents and provide an incentive for them to do so while providing decent entertainment.</p>
<p>Together with Kashif and Shanghai, GT&amp;T developed the concept of FastBall, a shortened version of Football. 15 minutes a side, the game has 15 members, 11 on field and four substitutes.</p>
<p>As a bonus to the game, a Blue Ball is introduced in the last 3 minutes of the game. Goals scored with the blue ball gives a double score making the game innovative and exciting.</p>
<p>FastBall was launched in May 2011. The knockout series will conclude with a grand finale on August 6, 2011. During all of the matches, fans have an opportunity to win millions through various GT&amp;T&rsquo;s promotions. This is the first time Guyana and the world is experiencing FastBall.</p></span>
