<h2>GTTi - Mobile Data Service</h2>
<img src="img/gtti.jpg" width="675" height="162" class="img-responsive"/>
<p>We recognize that there are mobile customers who are desirous of exploiting the benefits of mobile data service but who, for one reason or another, do not own a BlackBerry handheld.  We recognize too that many of the mobile devices used on our network are &quot;Smart Phones.&quot;
<p>  To satisfy the desire of this significant subset of our customer base, GT&amp;T's innovative technical staff has created a new service which we call GTTi . 
<p>  GTTi allows any customer with a Smartphone to purchase GT&amp;T's post-paid or pre-paid mobile data service.  Here's how it works!</p>
<br />
<h3>GTTi Pre-Paid</h3>
<p>  Every brand and model of Smartphone will need to be &quot;configured&quot; in a unique way to be able to access the GTTi service.  We publicize the Smartphone configuration information (codes, password, Access Point Name [APN], etc.) so that customers can do their own configuration.  In other words, we are not asking you to visit our Business Office or to pay any form of service activation. 
<p>  So, if you own a Smartphone and wish to enjoy GTTi, we offer you the choice of a daily, weekly or monthly mobile data plan.  Simply text: 
<ul>
  <li><strong>GT1D</strong> (for 1 day of data subscription) to 620-4884, or</li>
  <li>    <strong>GT1W</strong> (for 1 week of data subscription) to 620-4884, or </li>
  <li>    <strong>GT1M</strong> (for 1 month of subscription) to 620-4884. </li>
</ul>
<p>Having sent the text, our system will send you a confirmation message to ensure that you are expressing a serious desire.  Once you send an acknowledgement text, and your mobile account has sufficient credit to cover the cost of the plan you have requested, your Smartphone will be made ready for mobile data service. 
<p>  The <strong>daily plan costs $199</strong>,<strong> the weekly plan $999</strong> and the <strong>monthly plan $2,299</strong>.  The data allocations are 20MB, 120MB, and 400MB, respectively.  When your data allotment is exhausted, you must repeat the process for subscription described above and have sufficient balance to continue to enjoy any plan that meet your fancy.</p><br />

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<p> That depends on whether you wish to subscribe to a GTTi pre-paid or post-paid plan.  If you are a pre-paid voice customer and wish to subscribe to a GTTi pre-paid plan then you do not need to visit our business office since we will publicize the Access Point Name (APN) which you will need to configure your Smartphone and there is no service registration or activation charge.  If you are a post-paid voice customer and wish to subscribe to GTTi then you must select one of our post-paid plans and to do so you must visit the Business Office. </p>

<strong>Answer:</strong>
<p>We offer daily, weekly and monthly plans for pre-paid users.  The daily plan costs $199, the weekly plan costs $999 and the monthly plan costs $2,299.  To subscribe to any of these plans you do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Configure you Smartphone with the APN information publicized by GT&amp;T</li>
  <li> Make a decision on the plan you wish to subscribe to and ensure that you mobile account has sufficient funds to cover the cost of the plan</li>
  <li> Send an SMS with the following text to 620-4884:
    <ul>
      <li>    GT 1D (for 1 day of data subscription) </li>
      <li>    GT1W (for 1 week of data subscription) </li>
      <li>    GT1M (for 1 month of subscription) </li>
