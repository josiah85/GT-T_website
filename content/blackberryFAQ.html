<p>To subscribe to pre-paid BlackBerry&reg; service you must first ensure that your mobile account has at least a minimum balance of $100 plus sufficient funds to cover the BlackBerry&reg; service fee for your preferred period of service.&nbsp; If your balance is insufficient, you will receive a text message stating &lt;Your balance can't support this charge please recharge your account and try again&gt;.<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Send short message stating service type (i.e. BB) and service duration (i.e. 1W = 1 week); 5D = 5 days; 2M = two months; etc.) to 6204227.&nbsp; For example, text BB1W to sign up for 1 week of service.</li>
<li>The following registration confirmation message will be received: &lt;Your GT&amp;T BlackBerry&reg; service request has been received&gt;</li>
<li>Within 10 minutes re-send the same text (BB1W) to the same number (6204227) to accept the Terms of Service and activate your service.&nbsp; (Note that activation will be done on the second text if it is different from the first).</li>
<li>A second message will be received: &lt;Your confirmation message was received and your request is being processed&gt;</li>
<li>When we have completed your service activation you will receive the following message: &lt;Your GT&amp;T BlackBerry&reg; service is now active&gt;</li>
<li>Restart your handheld device if you are a new BlackBerry&reg; service user. </li>
<li>Your service is now registered, activated and ready for use </li>

<p>Yes.&nbsp; Anytime after the 10-minute period of the first activation, you can send a second subscription message to extend or reduce your service period.&nbsp; For example, if you had a 1-week service, sending BB2W will extend your service from 1 to 2 weeks.&nbsp; You will receive a confirmation messages stating that &lt;Your GT&amp;T BlackBerry service period has been extended&gt;.&nbsp; Again, if your current balance is insufficient for an increased period of service you will receive a message stating that &lt;Your balance cannot support this service extension, recharge your account and try again&gt;</p>

<p>When your subscription period has expired (or your data allocation has been exhausted) your BlackBerry&reg; account is suspended.&nbsp; You will be so notified by a message stating that &lt;Your GT&amp;T BlackBerry&reg; service has been suspended because you have exceeded your service time or data allocation&gt;.&nbsp; You must re-subscribes (similar to extending your service period) to continue to enjoy the service.&nbsp; Again, you will receive a message stating that &lt;Your GT&amp;T BlackBerry&reg; service resumption request has been received and is being processed&gt;.&nbsp; And, after the service is reactivated you will receive a message stating that &lt;Your GT&amp;T BlackBerry service is now resumed&gt;.&nbsp; Note that if a suspended account is not reactivated within 45 days, the account is cancelled and you will receive the following message: &lt;Your GT&amp;T BlackBerry&reg; service has been inactive for 45 days. Your service subscription has been cancelled&gt;.&nbsp; You must now re-subscribe to the service.</p>

<p>GT&amp;T will use its best efforts to notify customers when their balance is about to be exhausted.&nbsp; However, when and if your pre-paid BlackBerry&reg; balance finishes, you will still be able to send and receive calls and text messages (provided you have credit).&nbsp; Your BlackBerry&reg; service will be reactivated immediately upon your payment of the plan fee.</p>

<p>Yes.&nbsp; For post-paid customers, that fee will depend on the BlackBerry&reg; Plan selected.&nbsp; There is a monthly fee associated with each plan and customers must pay for any additional features requested. As with all post-paid services, you will receive a monthly bill which details the outstanding payment for the month completed.&nbsp; The bill is due on or before the second Saturday of every month.</p>

<p>GT&amp;T sells BlackBerry&reg; handhelds which are manufactured for use on GT&amp;T&rsquo;s network.&nbsp; GT&amp;T will, in its sole discretion decide whether or not to sell its BlackBerry&reg; service on non-GT&amp;T BlackBerry&reg; Handhelds. When and if we sell our service on a non-BlackBerry&reg; handheld, the service will be sold on a &ldquo;best effort&rdquo; basis, implying that GT&amp;T will assume no responsibility for below par service quality and user experience.</p>

<p>To set a password, go to the Options menu and select the Security item. Set the desired timeout (maybe 15 minutes) and enable/set a password.&nbsp; In conjunction with this, you should also go to the Options menu to the Owner item, and enter your name, phone number, etc. (When the password protection kicks in, this is what is displayed on the screen). After five incorrect attempts at typing in your password, the password starts echoing (figuring you really need all the help you can get). After ten attempts, it performs a lobotomy on itself and almost all data is cleared.&nbsp; The Memo database is retained and visible.</p>
