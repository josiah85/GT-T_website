<h2>DSL Services</h2>
<p>GT&amp;T offers high-speed Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) service over customers' existing (copper) telephone lines.  This high-speed (broadband) service is &quot;always on&quot; and opens up myriad opportunities for businesses and households to exploit the benefits which inhere in Internet access. </p>
<p>We offer a so-called &quot;legacy&quot; DSL service as well as our newer, regular DSL service, which was branded as &quot;E magine.&quot;  Our legacy DSL network has limited capacity and therefore the legacy service tends to be relatively expensive.  This capacity constraint has caused us to emphasize the sale of services with speeds of 256K only.  Customers wishing to purchase service with higher speeds on the legacy network are encouraged to contact our Service Representatives. </p>
<p>Currently, GT&amp;T's legacy DSL service is more widely available that its regular DSL service.
