<h2>Avoid  Service Disconnection</h2>

<p>Your telephone  bill arrives with a lag time of roughly 45 days.  In other words, the bill you receive with say  a January due date reflects calls you would have made at least one and a half  months ago.  Failure to pay your bill in  a timely fashion usually results in service disconnection for non-payment.  Remember, service disconnection is scheduled  for the second Sunday in every month.</p>
<p>Remember too that you can avoid disconnection by  calling the Business Office and requesting an extension of time.   We will give you a 1-week extension.  During that time your phone service is  restricted to making local (intra-exchange) calls only.  You will continue to be able to receive  calls.  If you believe that you will be  unable to make full payment within the time given, we advise that you visit our  Business Office and speak with a Supervisor who will provide guidance on how  you may be allowed to defray the bill without losing your service.  In fact, if at any time you experience  difficulties paying your bill in full, you should visit the Business Office  with proper identification and enter into an agreement to clear the bill in  installments which you find manageable.   We have no desire to deprive you of your wire line telephone service.   </p>
