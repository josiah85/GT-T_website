<h2>Land Line Pre-Paid Cards</h2>
<p>[image concept]: Manage your communication budget with our convenient land line scratch cards! </p>
<h3>Regular Scratch Cards</h3>
<p>Our regular land line scratch cards are for use in Guyana.  These are plastic cards with a 12-digit PIN printed and concealed on the reverse side. </p>
<p>  The PIN is revealed by lightly scratching the material that conceals it. </p>
<p>  Follow the instructions on the reverse side of the card when you wish to make land line calls from any GT&amp;T land line phone or phone booth. </p>
<p>  Our land line scratch cards are available in denominations of $500, $1,000 and $2,000.</p>
<p>Remember, the reverse side of the card has all the information you will need to use the card.</p><br />

<h3>Convenient and easy to useâ€¦</h3>
<p>  To make a local call using your scratch card, dial 0171 followed by your 12-digit PIN followed by the number you wish to call.</p>
<p>  To make a low-cost call to the USA, UK or Canada from any phone booth, dial 0171 followed by 156 followed by your 12-digit PIN followed by the international number you wish to call (international access code plus country code plus area code plus phone number). </p>
<p>  For example, to call 718-555-3972 from a phone booth, you dial</p>
<p><strong>0171156 PIN 001 1 718 555-3972</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>0171</strong> = Code to access the pre-paid platform</li>
  <li>    <strong>156</strong> = Code to access the low-cost international call</li>
  <li>    <strong>PIN</strong> = 12-Digit PIN</li>
  <li>    <strong>001</strong> = USA International Access code</li>
  <li><strong>    1</strong> = USA Country Code</li>
  <li>    <strong>718</strong> = A New York Area code </li>
  <li>    <strong>555-3972</strong> = your party's telephone number</li>
</ul>
<p>  Follow the same key sequence to make a low-cost call to the USA, UK or Canada from a land line phone between 01:00 hrs and 07:00 hrs daily.  In the example above, the only difference is that 155 is substituted for 156.<br />
